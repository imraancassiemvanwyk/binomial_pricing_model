# binomial_pricing_model
The implementation of the binomial pricing model uses the leisen-reimer model for binomial option pricing
this model converges to BSM model faster than other ones like the cox-rubenstein model and due the way i implemented
this model certain contraints like the tree having 29 levels can be aided by having a faster converging model.

To use the model make an instance of the object, set the parameters of the object and call the function that returns the value you want.
